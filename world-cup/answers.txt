Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
with a small number of predictions that is N=10,100 predictions seemed inaccurate

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: N=1000,after that the results stabalized
